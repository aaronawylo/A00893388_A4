You are a lost soul sent to the Underworld at the trickery of Eris, Goddess of Chaos. "Find your way back above ground 
if you want your revenge!" She cackles as you fall down in the depths of Hell. As you fall down into the abyss, a 
strange warmth envelopes your body and a voice whispers out to you. <br /> <br /> "We are Chaos, we will allow you
rebirth to escape the Underworld to exact your revenge on Eris. She has overstepped her bounds into our domain and this
cannot stand." <br /> <br /> "You will find the exit to Underworld on the other side of the world. We, Chaos, have
granted you the ability to come back from the brink of death. When a mortal blow is dealt and the River Styx takes you, 
you shall find yourself risen once more in Tartarus." <br /><br />"Tartarus, however, is an ever shifting domain of
Hades, to confuse and hinder souls from escaping the underworld. When you come back from death, you may find the realm
has changed."<br /><br />"Hades has also been informed of your intent to escape, and stands at the exit to block your
escape. Seek out the statues of the other Olympian Gods, they shall grant you power once, and aid you 
in your escape. The many traps may weaken you, but there is a single sanctuary dedicated to Persephone that will never
fade with use unlike the rest of the world."<br /><br />The voice fades, and you see a looming doorway ahead of you. You
muster up whatever courage you have, and enter:

Tartarus, The Labrynth of Hades.
